Each project idea must include at least the following information:

**Project name**: Choose a concise but descriptive title.

**Description**: A longer description of the documentation work required. Describe your initial idea in detail. Offer opportunities for any interested technical writers to expand or refine the idea.

**Related material**:
- Link to the open source project that needs documentation.
- If you're proposing a technical writing project that involves updates to an existing documentation set, link to that documentation set.
- If you're proposing a tutorial or a set of how-to guides, describe the features or use cases that need documenting.
- If you're proposing a contributor's guide, link to any existing README file or other relevant material if present. If there's nothing available yet, it's fine to say that.
- Include links to similar documentation in other projects, if relevant.
